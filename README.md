##Site Structure: 


The home page has a list of breweries and a map with the breweries locations. On the top left there is a dropdown list of the countries where the breweries are, and it filters the breweries by country. All the breweries in the list, and on the map are clickable, and they will open a list of the beer brands each one makes.


On the beers brand page if you click on a beer it will show some details on the right side of the page. 

There is also a search on this page, accessible by the dropdown menu, there is an option for search by name or by type of beer, and it will render a text input for each search.
Wrapping the pages there is a simple nav bar, to go back to the home page, and a footer.
